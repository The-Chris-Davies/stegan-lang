Stegan 2.0 TODO:
Interpreter:
	-variable definitions copying string to int / vice versa?
	-better error checking? (save location of function object / actual source of error?)
	-error checking: what if malloc/realloc == NULL?
	-end takes a variable reference to return?

Editor:
	-SAVING NEW IMAGE DOESN'T WORK???
	-Zoom and pan functions
	-better resize - pick which side to add to?
		-or in between rows/columns?
	-use chars to define vars
	-how to define int easily? (set vars next to it?)
		-or a tool that will tell you what pixels to put, given an int?

Documentation:
	-Errors / recursion depth page
		-fill in all different types of error
	-Make Examples and update example page!



DONE:
	-print function overhaul
	-variable definition -> 0 for int definition
	-math pixel checks for length 8 or whatever
	-new math functions: * and /
	-variable definitions work with copying already-existing variable (of the same type).
	-input works with vars / now 3 types instead of 2
	-new pixel: string!
